This is "inOut", an application to control your finances (in progress).

This project was born from this Django course by Dennis Ivy, applied in an e-commerce.

I took it as a starting point to build my own project to address a real problem of mine: controlling my finances. I was moving, so I had to be careful with my "inputs" and "outputs". At the same time, it served me to apply my knowledge and learn new ones.

I'm currently working on adding some functionality with AJAX: mainly a modal that shows a form every time you create (or update) an entry, or that shows a "delete confirmation" in case of deleting; instead of rendering another template.

Besides this, there is a lot of work to do in "inOut".  Let's do it!
